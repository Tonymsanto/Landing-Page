# Landing-Page
During this project, I wanted to create a more readable html script and accessible/functional webpage. There were a lot of <div> tags in the origianl index.html file that made it confusing to follow. The end goal was to really clean up the code, and make it read easier. I think that I was successful, and I was able to create cleaner code through using sematic HTML elements, and organinzing different sections so it is more structured. It really showed me the importance in readablity and strong syntax. I did struggle with one section, and that was trying to have <nav> tags replace the <div> tags in the <header> within <main>. When I tried using the <nav> tag, it was changing the view in the browser to a less diserable appearance. I tried altering the .css file to fix the formatting issues that were coming up, but couldn't debug that section.
